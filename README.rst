Phony Box
=====================
PhonyBox is an easy to use telephone system managment software written in Node.js and runs on top of `FreeSWITCH <https://www.freeswitch.org/>`_ and `Plivo <https://www.plivo.org/>`_.  If you are looking to setup a basic phone system for your home or office, look no further.

PhonyBox includes a `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com>`_ configuration file so you can fire up a virtual box complete with FreeSWITCH, Plivo, Node.js, and MongoDB.

PhonyBox front-end code is written with Backbone.js and is very modular and customizable.

Development Installation
------------------------

1. Install `Virtual Box <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ - a cross platform virtual machine program by Oracle

2. Install `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com>`_ - a virtual machine provisioner making it easier than ever to automate virtual machine setups

3. Check out the code...

4. In your terminal, go to the code directory and type: vagrant up (FYI - on first usage this downloads a rather large (1 gig) virtual machine file)

That is all! You now have a full phone system running in a virtual machine.
